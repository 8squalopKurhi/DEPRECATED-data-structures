- Automatic tracking: MatchMover 2013 can automatically detect and track the features in your video and generate a 3D camera path. You can also manually add or edit the tracking points for more accuracy and control.
- Calibration: MatchMover 2013 can estimate the camera parameters, such as focal length, distortion, and orientation, from the tracked points. You can also input the known camera settings or use a calibration grid for better results.
- Object tracking: MatchMover 2013 can track rigid or deformable objects in your video and create 3D models from them. You can use this feature to add or replace objects in your scene, such as cars, buildings, or characters.
- Export: MatchMover 2013 can export the tracking data to Maya or other 3D software in various formats, such as FBX, MA, MOV, or TXT. You can also export the tracked video as a background image sequence for compositing.

MatchMover 2013 is a versatile and easy-to-use software that can enhance your 3D animation workflow. You can download a free trial version from [https://www.autodesk.com/products/matchmover/overview](https://www.autodesk.com/products/matchmover/overview) and try it out for yourself.

In this article, we will show you how to use MatchMover 2013 to track a car in a video and replace it with a 3D model of a spaceship. You will need the following software and files:

- MatchMover 2013
- Maya 2013
- A video clip of a car driving on a road (you can download one from [https://www.pexels.com/video/a-car-driving-on-a-road-854053/](https://www.pexels.com/video/a-car-driving-on-a-road-854053/))
- A 3D model of a spaceship (you can download one from [https://free3d.com/3d-model/spaceship-1-674.html](https://free3d.com/3d-model/spaceship-1-674.html))

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open MatchMover 2013 and create a new project. Name it CarToSpace and choose the default settings.
2. Import the video clip of the car by clicking on File > Import Sequence. Browse to the folder where you saved the video and select it. Click on Open.
3. MatchMover 2013 will automatically start tracking the features in the video. You can see the progress in the bottom left corner of the screen. Wait until it finishes.
4. You can review the tracking results by playing the video in the viewer window. You can also switch to the 3D view by clicking on the icon in the top right corner of the screen. You should see a cloud of points representing the tracked features and a camera path showing the motion of the camera.
5. Next, you need to calibrate the camera parameters. Click on Edit > Camera Calibration. A dialog box will appear with some options. Choose Auto Calibration and click on OK.
6. MatchMover 2013 will estimate the camera parameters from the tracked points. You can see the results in the bottom right corner of the screen. You should see values for focal length, distortion, and orientation. If they are not reasonable, you can adjust them manually or use a calibration grid.
7. Now, you need to track the car object in the video. Click on Edit > Object Tracking. A dialog box will appear with some options. Choose Manual Tracking and click on OK.
8. A new window will open with two views: one showing the video frame and one showing the 3D view. You need to select four points on the car that are visible throughout the video. To do this, click on Add Point in the toolbar and then click on a point on the car in the video frame. Repeat this for three more points.
9. MatchMover 2013 will automatically track these points in the video and create a 3D object from them. You can see the progress in the bottom left corner of the screen. Wait until it finishes.
10. You can review the object tracking results by playing the video in both views. You should see a wireframe box representing the car object moving along with the video.
11. Next, you need to export the tracking data to Maya. Click on File > Export Scene As... A dialog box will appear with some options. Choose Maya ASCII (.ma) as the format and name it CarToSpace.ma. Click on Save.
12. Close MatchMover 2013 and open Maya 2013. Create a new scene and import CarToSpace.ma by clicking on File > Import... Browse to the folder where you saved it and select it. Click on Import.
13. You should see a camera and a locator in your scene representing the camera path and the car object from MatchMover 2013. You can play back the animation by clicking on Play in
the timeline.
14. Next, you need to import
the spaceship model by clicking on File > Import... Browse to
the folder where you saved it and select it. Click on Import.
15. You should see a spaceship model in your scene. You need to scale, rotate, and position it to match
the size and orientation of
the car object. To do this,
select both objects and go
to Modify > Match Transformations... A dialog box will appear with some options.
Choose Scale, Rotate, and Translate as
the attributes to match
and click on Apply.
16. The spaceship model should now align with
the car object. You can hide or delete
the car object by 8cf37b1e13

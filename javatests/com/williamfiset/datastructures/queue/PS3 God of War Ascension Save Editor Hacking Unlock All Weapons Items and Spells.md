Before we begin, you will need the following:
 
- A PS3 console or an emulator (RPCS3)
- A copy of God of War: Ascension
- A USB drive
- A PC with internet connection
- A PS3 save editor for God of War: Ascension (you can download it from [here\[^1^\]](https://github.com/Wulf2k/GoWSaveEdit) or [here\[^5^\]](https://www.thetechgame.com/Downloads/id=45885/god-of-war-ascension-save-editor-ps3.html))

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps:

1. Play a game in EASY mode on God of War: Ascension and save the game.
2. Copy your save file from your PS3 to your USB drive. The save file should be located in BCUS98232-PROFDATA-\*\\DAT-\* folder.
3. Plug your USB drive into your PC and open the PS3 save editor.
4. Load your save file into the program. You should see a list of codes that you can apply to your save file.
5. Edit your save file according to your preferences. You can find some codes from [here\[^2^\]](https://www.save-editor.com/tools_original/wse_ps3_save_editor_code_title.html?id=BCUS98232). For example, if you want to change the difficulty to TITAN, use this code: 80010004 2C04FF00 08000014 00000003
6. Save your modified save file and copy it back to your USB drive.
7. Plug your USB drive into your PS3 and overwrite your original save file.
